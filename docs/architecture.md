# KlasMwen Architecture Overview

## 1. Purpose

This document provides an in-depth look at **KlasMwen’s architecture**, explaining how different components interact, how data flows through the system, and the rationale behind key design decisions.

While the main README offers a high-level summary, this document focuses on **how and why** specific architectural patterns, tools, and integrations were chosen.

---

## 2. System Overview

KlasMwen follows a **modular monorepo architecture**, housing both frontend and backend projects under a single repository. Each workspace is designed for separation of concerns while allowing seamless coordination.

## 3. Backend Architecture

The **KlasMwen backend** is built with a clear and scalable **feature-based modular architecture** powered by **Express**, **TypeScript**, and **Prisma ORM**. The structure emphasizes separation of concerns, reusability, and maintainability.

### Backend Folder Structure Overview

    └── zodSchemas/             # Zod validation schemas for requests/responses
```

---

### Core Design Principles

- **Feature-based organization:** Each feature (e.g., posts, comments, users) encapsulates its business logic, making it easier to maintain and scale.
- **Separation of concerns:** Core configurations, middlewares, routes, and utilities are isolated for clarity.
- **Error management:** Centralized under `core/error`, ensuring consistent error handling throughout the application.
- **Type safety:** TypeScript is used end-to-end for better reliability and maintainability.
- **Validation:** All input validation is done using **Zod**, ensuring data integrity at runtime.

---

### Request Lifecycle Example

1. **Request Entry** → Incoming request hits a defined route in `routes/`.
2. **Controller Layer** → The controller handles input extraction and calls the respective feature service.
3. **Feature Logic** → The service in `features/` performs the necessary business logic (e.g., creating a post, fetching comments).
4. **Database Access** → Prisma interacts with PostgreSQL for data persistence.
5. **Response or Error** → Data is returned or errors are handled by `core/errors` middleware.

---

### 🧩 Example Flow — Creating a Post

```bash
Request (POST /api/posts)
   ↓
Routes → Controller → Post Service → Prisma (DB)
   ↓
Response (Created Post JSON)
```

This design pattern ensures that logic is centralized, errors are predictable, and new features can be added with minimal friction.

## 4. Frontend Architecture

The **KlasMwen frontend** is built with **React 19**, **Vite**, and **TypeScript**, following a **feature-oriented and component-driven** structure for clarity, scalability, and reusability.

---

### Frontend Folder Structure Overview

```bash
frontend/
├── src/
│   ├── api/                     # Axios instance and API modules
│   │   ├── api.ts               # Axios base instance setup
│   │   ├── auth.api.ts          # Auth-related API calls
│   │   ├── user.api.ts          # User-related API calls
│   │   ├── post.api.ts          # Post-related API calls
│   │   └── comment.api.ts       # Comment-related API calls
│   ├── components/              # Reusable UI components (buttons, modals, etc.)
│   ├── contexts/                # React context providers (e.g., theme, auth)
│   ├── features/                # Feature-specific UI and logic (posts, comments, etc.)
│   ├── hooks/                   # Custom reusable hooks
│   ├── lib/                     # Utility libraries (e.g., constants, formatters)
│   ├── pages/                   # Page-level components (routed views)
│   ├── queries/                 # TanStack Query hooks organized by domain
│   │   ├── useProfile.ts        # User profile-related queries
│   │   ├── useComment.ts        # Comment fetching/mutation hooks
│   │   └── useUserMutation.ts   # User mutation hooks
│   ├── stores/                  # Zustand stores for global state
│   ├── tests/                   # Frontend tests (Vitest + Testing Library)
│   ├── types/                   # Shared TypeScript types and interfaces
│   ├── utils/                   # Helper functions
│   ├── zodSchemas/              # Zod validation schemas and inferred types (aligned with backend)
│   ├── App.tsx                  # Root application component
│   └── main.tsx                 # Application entry point
```

---

### Key Design Decisions

- **shadcn/ui + TailwindCSS** → Provides a consistent, accessible, and elegant UI foundation.
- **TanStack Query (React Query)** → Manages server state and caching efficiently for all async data.
- **Zustand** → Lightweight global state management for auth, modals, and UI state.
- **React Hook Form + Zod** → Simplifies form handling and ensures type-safe validation matching backend rules.
- **Feature-based organization** → Keeps code modular, making each feature (auth, posts, comments, etc.) self-contained.
- **Markdown Support** → Enables rich text editing for posts, study materials, and notes.

---

### Data Flow Overview

```bash
[User Interaction]
      ↓
[React Components]
      ↓ (hooks)
[TanStack Query / API modules]
      ↓ (HTTP requests)
[Backend API (Express + Prisma)]
      ↓
[Database / Cloudinary]
```

This approach ensures a clear separation between **presentation**, **data fetching**, and **business logic**, making the frontend easy to extend, debug, and maintain.

```

- **Posts, Comments, and Tags**: Follows a relational model in PostgreSQL managed via Prisma.
- **File Uploads**: Files are first processed by Multer and then uploaded to Cloudinary.
- **Error Handling**: Consistent structure ensures the frontend can properly handle and display validation or server errors.

> For an in-depth overview of the frontend, refer to [Frontend Architecture Docs](./frontend-architecture.md)

## 6. Security Considerations

- **JWT Authentication**: Tokens stored as HTTP-only cookies to prevent XSS.
- **CORS Configuration**: Origin is restricted using `ALLOWED_ORIGIN` env variable.
- **Rate Limiting**: Managed by `express-rate-limit` to mitigate abuse.
- **Validation**: All user input validated through Zod.

---

## 7. Scalability and Future Improvements

- **Microservices Ready**: The modular backend structure can evolve into microservices if scaling requires it.
- **WebSocket Integration**: Future enhancement for real-time interactions (e.g., Q&A, notifications).
- **AI-Powered Assistance**: Potential integration for automated question answering.
- **Caching Layer**: Redis could be introduced for session caching or feed performance.
